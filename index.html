    <h2 style="color:black;"><u>What We Learnt and Discovered?</u></h2>
    
        <p><li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> We enhanced our knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by building an interactive animation into it. We got to know how to work with HTML5 and refer to the external webpage (W3School, Github) to draw and animate the experiment with the chemical reactions, and how to manage user interaction to make the simulation interesting.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Scientific Knowledge: </strong>We learned that it is hard to make complicated chemical ideas (such as knowledge of pH-values, neutralization) easy to visualize in simple ways that can be comprehended by non-experts. This took a lot of planning and research.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Project Management: </strong>We have learned how to subdivide a large project into small, manageable tasks (e.g. research, design, code, testing) and to allocate them depending on the strengths of each member.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Collaboration and Communication Skills:</strong>We identified that frequent communication and peer feedback played a very important role. When a particular member was not making headway on a certain coding problem, another could tend to give a fresh angle or a different approach, and we ended up with a superior final product than either of us would have produced individually.</li></p>

    <h2 style="color:black;"><u>Feedback on Team Members' Contributions</u></h4>
        <h3>TONG Wing Yan  (57905703)</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Contributions: </strong>Wing Yan designed and created all experimental webpages, which included creating custom animations for each experiment and conducting research on acid-base reactions between various materials. She also conducted real-world experiments with DIY pH indicators to ensure the simulations' accuracy and educational value.</p>
            <p><strong>Team Feedback: </strong>Wing Yan was very responsible for the animation design. Although she did not have knowledge of animation before, she dedicated herself to learn through online platforms such as W3Schools. She diligently tested various elements and incorporated continuous team feedback, aiming to achieve a high-quality final product.</p>
		<br/>
        <h3>TAM Wing Nga (58196547)</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Contributions: </strong>Wing Nga was responsible to design the overall user interface and styling using CSS and JavaScript. She created all the custom buttons and implemented the interactive elements, like the feedback. She made sure that the web page was attractive and easy to use. </p>
            <p><strong>Team Feedback: </strong> Wing Nga is very design-conscious. Her attention to detail had transformed our simulation not only to be functional, but also professional and interesting. She was very active in getting feedback regarding her designs. She also helped us in detecting bugs, which contributed significantly to the overall user experience.</p>
		<br/>
        <h3>WONG Cheuk Wing  (58112774)</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Contributions: </strong>Cheuk Wing was responsible for making our presentation video, including the voiceover script, video editing and the subtitles. She carefully selected the most suitable content to highlight around one minute, which can ensure the video was both educational and engaging.  </p>
            <p><strong>Team Feedback: </strong>Cheuk Wing has well organization of the video production process. She ensure the final video met all the technical and submission requirements. Her ability to change those complex chemistry concepts into a concise and visually appealing video has helped the overall quality of our project. We appreciated her creativity, time management and effort on this project. </p>
		<br/>
        <h3>WONG Ching Yu  (58620001)</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Contributions: </strong> Ching Yu focused on the quiz webpage design and content, creating simple and clear quiz questions, making the webpage more interactive. She also made good use of buttons to move forward to the next or previous question, as well as to start or restart the quiz.</p>
            <p><strong>Team Feedback: </strong> Ching Yu’s creativity significantly increased the quiz’s engagement with the intuitive user flow. Her contribution improved the final experience of the user. She was a reliable and hard-working member.</p>

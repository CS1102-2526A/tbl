    <h2 style="color:black;"><u>What We Learnt and Discovered?</u></h2>
    
        <p><li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> We enhanced our knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by building an interactive animation into it. We got to know how to work with HTML5 and refer to the external webpage (W3School, Github) to draw and animate the experiment with the chemical reactions, and how to manage user interaction to make the simulation interesting.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Scientific Knowledge: </strong>We learned that it is hard to make complicated chemical ideas (such as knowledge of pH-values, neutralization) easy to visualize in simple ways that can be comprehended by non-experts. This took a lot of planning and research.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Project Management: </strong>We have learned how to subdivide a large project into small, manageable tasks (e.g. research, design, code, testing) and to allocate them depending on the strengths of each member.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Collaboration and Communication Skills:</strong>We identified that frequent communication and peer feedback played a very important role. When a particular member was not making headway on a certain coding problem, another could tend to give a fresh angle or a different approach, and we ended up with a superior final product than either of us would have produced individually.</li></p>

        <h3>TAM Wing Nga (58196547)</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Contributions:</strong>Wing Nga was responsible to designe the overall user interface and styling using CSS and JavaScript. She created all the custom buttons and implemented the interactive elements, like the feedback. She made sure that the web page was attractive and easy to use. </p>
            <p><strong>Team Feedback:</strong> Wing Nga is very design-conscious. Her attention to detail had transformed our simulation not only to be functional, but also professional and interesting. She was very active in getting feedback regarding her designs. She also helped us in detecting bugs, which contributed significantly to the overall user experience.</p>
